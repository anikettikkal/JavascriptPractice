                In case of a planned admission, you would have first consulted a doctor who in turn would have advised
                you on the probable date of hospitalization. In such a case, you must apply for approval of the
                estimated hospital expenses directly by your TPA at least 4-5 days prior to the date of hospitalization.
                <br> <br>

                In case you have not applied for pre-authorization sufficiently in advance or if the doctor treating you
                advises you to get hospitalized immediately after the consultation, our Corporate Help Desk (Phone:
                022-24460649 / 24447543) will assist you through the preauthorization procedure. Normal working hours
                are from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm, Monday to Saturday and on Sunday /Hospital Holidays from 9.00 am to 5.00
                pm. <br> <br>

                However, the Corporate/TPA Help Desk is only a facilitator and can in no way influence the decision on
                the approval. Your TPA may not grant approval due to any of the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the ailment for which you are hospitalized is not covered in your policy.</li>
                <li>If the information contained in pre-authorization form is insufficient to approve the request,
                    though most of the time the TPA will request the hospital if additional information is needed.</li>
                <li>If you have exhausted the sum assured for that year.</li>
            </ul>
