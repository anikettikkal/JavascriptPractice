                In case of a planned admission, you would have first consulted a doctor who in turn would have advised
                you on the probable date of hospitalization. In such a case, you must apply for approval of the
                estimated hospital expenses directly by your TPA at least 4-5 days prior to the date of hospitalization.
                <br> <br>

                In case you have not applied for pre-authorization sufficiently in advance or if the doctor treating you
                advises you to get hospitalized immediately after the consultation, our Corporate Help Desk (Phone:
                022-24460649 / 24447543) will assist you through the preauthorization procedure. Normal working hours
                are from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm, Monday to Saturday and on Sunday /Hospital Holidays from 9.00 am to 5.00
                pm. <br> <br>

                However, the Corporate/TPA Help Desk is only a facilitator and can in no way influence the decision on
                the approval. Your TPA may not grant approval due to any of the following reasons:
            </p>


            <ul>
                <li>If the ailment for which you are hospitalized is not covered in your policy.</li>
                <li>If the information contained in pre-authorization form is insufficient to approve the request,
                    though most of the time the TPA will request the hospital if additional information is needed.</li>
                <li>If you have exhausted the sum assured for that year.</li>
            </ul>


            <u>
                <h1>The pre-authorization procedure is detailed below:</h1>
            </u>
            <h4><u>Step 1:</u> Establish contact with the Corporate Help Desk at the hospital or please refer here for all the
                information related to cashless processing or reimbursement. <br> <br>

                <u>Step 2:</u> Collect the pre-authorization forms pertaining to your TPA + TPA Checklist + TPA undertaking
                form from OPD Customer care help desk/ Doctor's secretaries / West block help desk or download all these
                forms. Please present your Health Insurance card for the staff to assist you appropriately.  <br> <br>

                <u>Step 3:</u> Form Filling - your pre-authorization form will have two sections-
                General details on the health insurance policy - to be filled in by you (the TPA Help Desk will assist
                you in case you have any difficulty). <br>
                The treatment recommended for you - to be filled in and duly signed by the doctor who is treating you
                (Do not attempt to fill this section, contact the TPA Help Desk in case of any difficulty). TPA
                Checklist + TPA undertaking forms are self-explanatory. <br><br>

                <u>Step 4:</u> Return the completed form (filled and signed), along with the copies of the document mentioned
                in TPA check list to the TPA Help Desk/ ELSE make a single pdf file of all your documents (as per TPA
                checklist) and email to tpacell@hindujahospital.com, with subject as 'Patient's name, HH Number and
                mobile number'. The personnel at the desk will verify the form for its completeness and let you know in
                case of any discrepancy. <br> <br>

                <u>Step 5:</u> Once the form is completely filled, the TPA Help Desk will upload the documents on the portal
                and transmit to the office of your TPA. <br><br>

                <u>Step 6:</u> The TPA Help Desk will revert to you with the approval/ denial status and also the status of
                approval is updated on registered mobile number, as well as on the display screen available near the TPA
                Help desk in the ground floor lobby. <br> <br>

                <u>Step 7:</u> At the time of admission, you shall be required to pay differential amount of admission deposit
                and TPA approval. The differential amount would be refunded on discharge after receiving the final
                approval as per the final bill. A TPA deposit payment of Rs.7500/- has to be paid on admission, which
                shall be refunded post discharge, subject to completion of all formalities and payment received by the
                hospital, and may take 45-90 days.
