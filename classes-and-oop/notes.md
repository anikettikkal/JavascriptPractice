- Abstrction 
"ple that helps simplify complex systems by reducing unnecessary details and exposing only the essential parts of an object or function. Abstraction is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that aims to create a clear and simple interface for interacting with more complex code, making code easier to read, maintain, and modify."


- Encapsulation
"encapsulation is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that restricts direct access to some components of an object, which protects the internal state of that object. Encapsulation is all about bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within one unit (like a class) and controlling access to them."


- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
